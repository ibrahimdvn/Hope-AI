## About This Project

Hope AI Studio is more than a simple landing page; it's a fully-realized corporate website designed to attract clients, detail services, and provide comprehensive business information. The primary goal was to create a clean, modern, and trustworthy digital experience that reflects the innovative nature of an AI company.

Every aspect of the site, from its multi-language functionality to its detailed service pages, was carefully planned and executed to showcase a developer's ability to handle a complex, real-world web project.

## Key Features

This project is packed with features that highlight a deep understanding of modern web development:

* **Comprehensive Multi-Page Architecture:** The website is structured with a complete and logical site map to cover all aspects of a corporate presence:
    * **Home (`index.html`):** A powerful hero section and service summary.
    * **Services (`services.html`):** An overview of all services offered.
    * **Service Detail Pages:** In-depth pages for each service (`chatbot.development.html`, `content-creation.html`, `custom-ai-solutions.html`).
    * **Process (`process.html`):** A step-by-step explanation of the company's workflow.
    * **Pricing (`pricing.html`):** Detailed, multi-tiered pricing plans.
    * **FAQ (`faq.html`):** A section to proactively answer common client questions.
    * **Contact (`contact.html` & `contact-enterprise.html`):** Multiple, purpose-driven contact forms.
    * **Payment Pages:** Static pages detailing payment instructions for different plans.

* **Advanced Internationalization (i18n):**
    * The entire website supports three languages: **English, Turkish, and Italian**.
    * A custom JavaScript solution (`language-switcher.js`) dynamically fetches and applies translations from `.json` files.
    * The user's language preference is saved to `localStorage`, ensuring a consistent experience across sessions and pages.
    * The UI includes a clean, intuitive language switcher dropdown in the navigation bar.

* **Modern & Responsive UI/UX:**
    * A sleek, professional dark-mode theme is used across the entire site for brand consistency.
    * The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
    * Utilizes a modern, readable font stack (`Inter`) for excellent typography.
    * Features subtle UI elements like hover effects, button transitions, and clean mockups to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

This project was built from the ground up to showcase mastery of core front-end technologies without relying on external frameworks.

* **HTML5:** Structured with semantic elements for accessibility and SEO.
* **CSS3:** Used for all styling, layout, and responsiveness. Key features include:
    * **CSS Variables:** For a maintainable and consistent theming system.
    * **Flexbox & Grid:** For creating complex and responsive layouts.
    * **Transitions & Hover Effects:** To create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers all the dynamic functionality of the site:
    * **Internationalization (i18n):** A custom script fetches JSON files and populates the DOM with the correct language strings.
    * **DOM Manipulation:** Used extensively to update content based on user interaction.
    * **`localStorage` API:** To store and retrieve user's language preference.
    * **Event Handling:** For all interactive elements, including the language switcher and navigation.
